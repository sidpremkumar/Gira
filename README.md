# JiraClient
Saddened by the news that Atlassian will be deprecating support for their Jira macOS app, we decided to try to build our own!

</p>

## Developing

To start the app locally you can run the following commands
```
> npm install
> npm run start
```

## Building 

We use [Electrion Forge](https://www.electronforge.io) to build. To build for your OS you can run the following command: 

```
> npm run make
```

And the relevant files can be found under `./out`!i
